# Qleric 

## About

Qleric Labs is an experimental space dedicated to rapid prototyping and practical innovation in legal tech.  
We explore new approaches, research emerging techniques, build working prototypes, and spin out ideas into focused, open-source tools.

The goal is simple: create tools that are lightweight, privacy-first, and immediately useful to legal professionals and researchers.

## Philosophy

- **Explore** – investigate problems in contracts, legal text, and workflows.  
- **Research** – combine LLMs, NLP, and structured methods for reliability.  
- **Build** – develop minimal tools that solve concrete problems.  
- **Spin out** – release successful experiments as standalone, reusable projects.

## Approach

- **Open-source** – MIT licensed, community-friendly  
- **Privacy-first** – documents stay local, only prompts reach the API  
- **Rapid development** – prototypes move quickly from idea to tool  
- **Practical focus** – avoid bloat, ship tools that work
