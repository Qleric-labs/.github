# Qleric 

## About

Qleric Labs is an experimental space dedicated to rapid prototyping and practical innovation in legal tech.  
We explore new approaches, research emerging techniques, build working prototypes, and spin out ideas into focused, open-source tools.

The goal is simple: create tools that are lightweight, privacy-first, and immediately useful to legal professionals and researchers.

Long-term, the lab aims to explore advanced areas such as contract redlining, multilingual analysis, and explainable legal AI — pushing the ceiling of what lightweight legal tech can do.

## Philosophy

- **Explore** – investigate problems in contracts, legal text, and workflows.  
- **Research** – combine LLMs, NLP, and structured methods for reliability.  
- **Build** – develop minimal tools that solve concrete problems.  
- **Spin out** – release successful experiments as standalone, reusable projects.

## Projects

- **Contract Extraction Assistant** – Extract key dates, clauses, and terms from contracts with structured outputs.  

**Upcoming (near-term):**
- Clause analyzers – identify and compare contractual clauses  
- Legal summarizers – condense contracts and judgments into structured insights  
- Redaction utilities – detect and remove sensitive data from documents  

**Exploratory (long-term):**
- Contract redlining – AI-assisted review of changes and negotiation points  
- Audit and explainability tools – traceable outputs with reasoning alongside text  
- Multi-language support – cross-border analysis and aligned translations

## Approach

- **Open-source** – MIT licensed, community-friendly  
- **Privacy-first** – documents stay local, only prompts reach the API  
- **Rapid development** – prototypes move quickly from idea to tool  
- **Practical focus** – avoid bloat, ship tools that work
